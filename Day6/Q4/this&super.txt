Q-  ‘this’ and ‘super’ keyword in java

super Keyword
A reserved keyword used to call the base class method or variable is known as a super keyword. 
We cannot use the super keyword as an identifier. 
The super keyword is not only used to refer to the base class instance but also static members too.

super() Constructor
The super() is mainly used for invoking base class member functions and constructors.

this keyword
It is a reserved keyword in Java that is used to refer to the current class object. 
It is a reference variable through which the method is called. Other uses of this keyword are:


We can use it to refer current class instance variable.
We can use it to invoke the current class method (implicitly).
We can pass it as an argument in the method and constructor calls.
We can also use it for returning the current class instance from the method.

this() Constructor
